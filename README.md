# student-placement-prediction
This project builds a machine learning model to predict student job placements based on CGPA and IQ. The notebook covers data preprocessing, training a classifier, and visualizing decision boundaries. Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, MLxtend. Suitable for education and career prediction analysis.

Student Placement Prediction Model
This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts whether a student is likely to be placed in a job based on their CGPA and IQ level. The model is trained using a dataset of students' academic performance and intelligence metrics, with the goal of predicting binary job placement outcomes (Yes/No).

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: The dataset contains features like CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) and IQ (Intelligence Quotient), and the target variable is whether the student was placed (1) or not placed (0).
Modeling: The notebook implements and trains a machine learning classification model to predict the placement status of students.
Evaluation: The model is evaluated based on accuracy, and other metrics can be added for further analysis.
Visualization: The decision boundary for the classification model is plotted to provide a visual representation of how the model distinguishes between placed and non-placed students.
Libraries Used
Pandas: For data loading and manipulation.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning model building and evaluation.
Matplotlib: For plotting and visualizations.
MLxtend: For plotting the decision boundaries of the classifier.


Potential Improvements
Hyperparameter Tuning: Further fine-tuning of the model parameters to improve accuracy.
Additional Features: Incorporating other relevant features like extracurricular activities, internship experience, etc., to enhance predictions.
Model Comparison: Adding multiple machine learning models and comparing their performance.
